* For those who are not in a hurry, and want to soak up the sights and sounds of teh area, we recommend that instead of taking the official Lycian Way between Faralya and Kabak which is shorter, take the long scenic way around the stunning coastal area between the two villages.
* You will get some great views into Butterfly valley before passing through some lovely red pine forest, before descending to Aktas beach for a swim. The path continues along the coast with views to the seven capes, before climbing up to the village of Kabak.

### 3. Kabak - Alinca - Gey 16km

* One of the most satisfying and spectacular walks on the Lycian Way is undoubtebly this one.
* Starting up from Kabak village on a good mule track, the path rises into a seemingly impassable valley.  
* The path goes past an area called Delikkaya (the holey rock) which after a heavy rainstorm has water spouting from many hundreds of holes in the cliff.
* Arriving at the stunning watershed of Alinca,  you will want to stop for a coffee at Catchy Camping, run by Özkan, probably visualy the best coffee anywhere!
* The path below Alınca, above 'Paradise Bay' is as tricky as it is spectacular, not for the faint hearted. If you do not like walking close to the edge you can follow the asphalt road for a few km instead.
* You pass the famous slab, and then drop down to the Ottoman cistern in the terraces at the end of Bogazici village.
* From here you climb to the village of Gey on the ridge.  For a great welcome stay in Dumanoglu pansiyon!

The walk follows the aqueduct system as it contours around the hillside before it gets lost in the forest.
* Picking up the forest road later, you start to get views of the fertile Xanthos valley and also the dunes and remains of Patara, before picking up the aqueduct again as you descend to the magnificent site of Patara itself.

* This wild lonely section of the Lycian Way is best walked early or late in the season as there is not much shade and no reliable water en route.
* The coastline is rugged and the sea views are splendid. You will see few others around here!  Climbing up to Apollonia is well worth the effort however, with some very well preserved sarcophagi, a small theater and a very atmospheric church from the Byzantine period to be found.  There is accommodation in Bogazcik village.
