# Religions and Dualism

Sep 5, 2020

Here is a little fun fact about me.

In my Turkish ID, it says my religion is Islam. When I was in Oakland, I had a few visits to the Protestant church there and the Papa was nice enough to convert me to christianity with a nice little ceremony where I had water splash in my head on one ordinary afternoon. I wasn't really Christian but had to be one to marry my wife [Nova](https://novatogatorop.com) officially.

In paper, I'm both Muslim and Christian. In practice, I consider myself as Atheist, Buddhist, Muslim and Christian at the same time. Tell me about Judaism, I might become little bit Jewish, too.

Of course, one might say "you're actually none of them because you have to choose one".

Why do we have to choose one though ? Aren't they all just beliefs anyways ?

If I speak for Islam, there were some Islamic thought leaders who had quite unusual angles about God, universe and human nature. One of them is Mansur-u Hallac. He was beheaded for declaring himself (and everybody, all humanity) as the God.

His angle was simple; would people stay as who they are after death, even if we assume that we have souls. Or, would they become one, as they were, before birth ?

Here is another way to think of same thing; what does make the room you're currently in? The walls and the roof ? Partially, yes. Looking at the walls and the roof, we can say that there is a room. However, what makes the room is actually the space inside. And that space existed forever. Even before the big-bang. So, We can have the walls that separates the space in our own experience. But the space is one.

In the other words; we can have our bodies separating us from eachother temporarily. Our soul is one though.
