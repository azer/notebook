# Ego and Integrity

Jan 30, 2020

The word "Ego" is often used in group conversations to draw attentin to the potential beyond our individual abilities and interests. 
However, the definition of ego is not explored much, and I have great doubts that if people even have a shared understanding of it while
mentioning it in a conversation. We'd often denounce "too much" of ego, and on the other hand, also emphasize the need for "some" ego.

How would we define the word "ego" though? Ego is the distance we "feel" or "see" between ourselves and others. We compare ourselves
with others, come up with a certain distance. We feel really close to someone we like, or we might have some negative emotions that triggers
us to feel comfortable about not having any sympathy towards someone we feel "distant" to us.

Interesting enough, the best definition of integrity I know is the distance between appearance and reality. For example, if we steal
an apple from someone's garden, that's stealing, a mistake that makes us less sincere, less ethical. And now let's imagine the owner of the garden
has a suspicion and asks if we stole an apple from their garden. If we say "yes", we accept our inethical behavior and also accept the
cost of our behavior. However, if we say no, in other words, if we make it look like we do not steal apples, we are then truly immoral and corrupt.
