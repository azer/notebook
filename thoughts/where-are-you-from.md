# Where are you from?

Where are you from?

This question has been echoing in my head since I moved to Germany. Every introduction conversation definitely starts with it, and occasionally, ends right at the answer of this question: I'm Turkish.

Who am I? How am I doing? What do I do ? What do I suffer from? How am I trying to be a better human being?

Not interesting.

I was born in Turkey. I'm a Turkish male. These two are the two indefensible shared attributes with Erdogan, the demon of the decade.

And that gives me a role to play in life: being the guy from Erdogan's country.

Here is a real conversation I had:

- Hi! (smiling)
- Hi! Where are you from?
- Turkey!
- Oh, I hate your president!
- ...

And it's only one of them. Somebody approaches during a party I'm invited to, and starts talking about Erdogan. I share about a business book I liked a lot (Zero to One), a dickhead jumps and tells "Adolf Hitler's book was the most popular book in Turkey for a while" as a response.

I'm being put in situations where I have to invest my energy into convincing the others that I'm not some sort of subpersonality of Erdogan.

This feels like... the biggest disappointment of my life.
