# Where are you from?

Where are you from?

This question has been echoing in my head since I moved to Germany. Every introduction conversation definitely starts with it, and occasionally, ends right at the answer of this question: I'm Turkish.

Who am I? How am I doing? What do I do ? What do I suffer from? What are some good things about me ? How am I trying to be a better human being?

Not interesting.

I was born in Turkey. Indefensibly, I was born as Turkish male. And yes, these two are the two shared attributes with Erdogan, the demon of the decade.

And that gives me a very specific role to play in life, making impossible to go beyond of it.

Here is a real conversation I had:

- Hi! (smiling)
- Hi! Where are you from?
- Turkey!
- Oh, I hate your president!
- ...

And it's only one of them.

Somebody approaches during a party I'm invited to, and starts talking about Erdogan.

Two coworkers are having a heated argument about whether if it's ethical to read Zero to One, authored by Peter Thiel, who supported Trump. I tell that it's a good book, worth to read, to reduce the heat, and a dickhead jumps and tells "Adolf Hitler's book was the most popular book in Turkey for a while" as a response.

I'm being put in situations where I have to invest my energy into convincing the others that I'm not some sort of subpersonality of Erdogan.

And this feels like... the biggest disappointment of my life.
