# Where are you from?

Where are you from?

Where are you from?

Where are you from?

This question has been echoing in my head since I moved to Germany. Every introduction conversation definitely starts with it, and occasionally, ends right at the answer of this question: I'm Turkish.

Who am I? How am I doing? What do I do ? What do I suffer from? What are some good things about me ? How am I trying to be a better human being?

Not interesting.

I was born in Turkey. Indefensibly, I'm a Turkish male, just like the demon of the decade, Erdogan.

Here is a real conversation I had:

- Hi! (smiling)
- Hi! Where are you from?
- Turkey!
- Oh, I hate your president!
- ...

And it's only one of them.

Somebody approaches during a party I'm invited to, and starts talking about Erdogan. What if I'm not interested to talk about Erdogan? 
Just like any person who reserves their energy for things other than politics in life?

Two coworkers are having a heated argument about whether if it's ethical to read Zero to One, authored by Peter Thiel, who supported Trump. I tell that it's a good book, worth to read, to reduce the heat, and a dickhead jumps and tells "Adolf Hitler's book was the most popular book in Turkey for a while" as a response.

I'm being put in situations where I have to invest my energy into convincing the others that I'm not some sort of subpersonality of Erdogan.

And this feels like... the biggest disappointment of my life.
