## Jatiluwih 

27.03.2016

Once I walked into a Hindu village on top of mountains covered by rice fields. #Jatiluwih. My right foot was broken, and women were smiling and asking what happened to my foot. I didn't know their language, so used sign language to explain how I fell down and broke my feet.

They invited me to join their baby shower ceremony. We had breakfast and lunch together. My wife @thesupernovaworld joined me, and we met almost everyone in the village. Lots of laughters and selfies filled our time. Right place and right time.

The way they live inspired me a lot. Their houses consist of only bedrooms, everything else is common. The houses are very close to eachother, only two humans can walk between houses. Bathroom is shared. Kitchen is shared. And this is the photo of their #kitchen. They were washing dishes after the lunch.
