# Suffer

```
Cümle kuşlar dile gelir yazım der,
gövel turnam şam'a gelir güzüm der,
benim yaralarım "tuzum, tuzum" der,
bir derdim var, bin dermana değişmem.
```

Harari's famous Sapiens book has a section about one big difference of humans from animals; we tell stories, animals don't. This power, ability create fictional entities and tell stories, helped us to create money, market economy, and technologies we have today.

And now, we often struggle to confuse our stories with reality. We're less present in the moment. We can't tell what is real and what's not. Harari, offers one simple test to identify what's real and what's not; to tell if something is real, ask if it suffers. Can a company suffer? No. Can a cat suffer? Yes.

Suffer is what makes one real or not.

It's also what unifies the four big religions. Buddhism counts suffering as one of the first noble truths.
The all three Abrahamic religions tell us the story of Adam and Eve, eating the apple, and waking up from unconsciousness, starting to notice the good and evil; their own vulnerability. Now they were aware of their own death and subject to suffer from negative emotions rest of their lives after eating the apple from the knowledge tree of good and evil.

Suffering is a part of being.

Acceptance of this is a big relief, it helps us to correct our vision and can be also useful in difficult decision making. What do I mean by correction of our vision? Most people compare mix their desires and impulses into their decision making. Clearing out our sight and just considering the suffering behind different choices, one can make better decisions in general.

A simple example can be; choosing between going to dentist, or our favorite cafe with great chocolate cakes. Now let's disregard the desires behind these two options and think about just suffering. The suffering of going to dentist would be waiting in a boring office for an hour, feeling uncomfortable during the treatment and after treatment for a day. The suffering of going to the cafe would be growing issues in our dental health, as delayed to unknown time in the future.

A lot of choices in our life are not as clear as this example, the framework itself can help us in many cases though.
