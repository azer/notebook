## The Unknown

If Robinson Crusoe's boat wrecked in the ocean today, Crusoe would first try to find a water-resistant mobile phone with working GPS and map in the wreckage. It'd be the story of somebody looking for signal, if not a charging cable.

From the highest peak in our planet, Mount Everest, to the deepest points of our oceans has been explored; leaving a planet with nearly no environmental mystery left to the future generations. On the other hand, the same technology also created its own mystery; while some of us live a highly predictable life, some of us lives every day like  d'Artagnan leaving his little village Gascony and heading to Paris at the age of 14.

Technology removed some mystery, and pushed us closer to some more.

There is a place in the space and time that we all sense it deeply, and we don't talk enough about: the edge of the unknown. It's that bizarre, uncomfortable
state in which random events can quickly render our basic needs like food and sleep, or emotional needs such as cooperation and compassion out of our reach.

And this particular state of life is what criminals, politicians, startup founders and mad people have in the common: being in the battlefield with the unknown every day.
Constantly coming up with practical responses, or developing systems that helps the individual or the company to quickly sort out the predictable challenges of near term. It's hard, exhausting and stressful; that's probably why many people choose stability over adventure. On the other hand, even a short journey into the unknown can get unique, rich experience with priceless learnings.

What is the unknown though?

I find it useful to unpack the unknown into three interconnected elements; present chaos, future uncertainty and freedom. The frontier of the unknown will have no hierarchy if none built yet; this indeed means complete freedom, and of course, chaos. Our every day activities to battle the present chaos will need to prove their merits across the time, and I refer to this element of the unknown as, the future uncertainty.
