# Highlights

## Introduction

* The New Rich baffle so many people because they don’t play by the old rules of business that the masses follow. You’ve been sold these rules by “mentors,” but you must forget them to join the New Rich:
  * Focus on becoming an expert at one thing.
  * Come up with a remarkable idea.
  * Set goals and work toward them.
  * Give customers what they want.

#### RULE 1: Don’t Focus on One Thing.

* Focusing on one thing gives you a single point of failure—whether it’s a job, an investment opportunity, or an entrepreneurial venture.
* Likewise, you’d never want to build your wealth around one endeavor. If that one thing fails, you’re destroyed, and you have to start again from scratch. Ignore the conventional wisdom that says it’s impossible to multitask.

#### RULE 2: Copy Your Competitors.

* Every. Single. Detail. Have you ever thought, “Ugh, I would be rich if I’d only come up with XYZ idea that is making that other guy millions”? Are you kidding? Copy him. You don’t need your own idea. Launching a new idea is actually a terrible approach to gaining wealth—you have to pay for all the mistakes yourself. Why?! The way to get filthy rich is by aggressively copying others and then adding your own twist.

#### RULE 3: Quit Setting Goals—They’re Keeping You Broke.

* Setting a goal is like saying, “I want that golden egg.” It can be a Rolex watch, Beverly Hills mansion, $500M private jet, $2K dinner at your favorite restaurant. Whatever. If you build your life around a goal, the second you achieve it, it seems like there’s nothing left to achieve. And you end up bored. You’ll have to remotivate yourself to come up with another golden egg to chase. It’s much better to invest your energy into creating, feeding, and nursing a system that pumps out golden eggs every day.

#### RULE 4: Sell Pickaxes to Gold Miners.

The essence of this rule is to let others cut a trail through the thick jungle so you can then peacefully walk in and capitalize on their hard work. That’s what people did during the gold rush. The gold miners went west, hunting, searching, sweating, bleeding, killing, and dying just to make it out there. After they arrived they realized they needed pickaxes to mine more efficiently. Well, then others just traveled over on the paths already created to sell those pickaxes to the gold miners. They got rich without any of the risk, sweat, or bloodshed. In today’s world this translates to siphoning revenue from a hot market that others put the effort into building.


#### YOUR NEW RICH PLAN AT TEN THOUSAND FEET

Here’s an aerial view of what your journey to wealth might look like if you follow the advice in this book:

* Start at zero. No start-up capital. No trust fund check from Grandma. No high-earning spouse contributing the cash to get your ventures off the ground.
* Leverage the four tactics I used to generate over $10K in cash and start funding my own ventures by the time I was twenty-one years old.
* As money comes in, you will:
  * Spend it however you want to make sure you’re living a happy, healthy life.
  * Go on vacation. Get a mocha every morning. Buy that Anthropologie dress even if it’s not on sale.
  * Invest it back into your current ventures in unique ways. Invest it in real estate using very little capital.
  * Outright buy other companies for pennies on the dollar using the negotiation tactics I teach.
  * Build a war chest to fund any next business venture you want as you see fit.

* I will show you how to do all of these things. Is it simple? Yes. Is it easy? No. In music, there are only seven notes. Anyone can know them. So why do some people create hit songs while others can barely sing? The answer is in the combination of those seven notes.
* Business is even simpler—it only has four notes. This book will teach you the unique ways to combine those four notes, or principles, to create masterpieces that put money in your bank account.


## RULES TO BREAK, RULES TO EMBRACE

#### RULE 1: DON’T FOCUS ON ONE THING

* That’s fine if you aspire to become, say, the world’s top neurosurgeon. But it’s terrible advice if you actually want to get rich and work less.
* I already mentioned one problem with this approach: it gives you a single point of failure. If you put all your trust and resources into one thing, and that one thing fails, you’re screwed.
* Even if you do become the world’s—or your region’s—top neurosurgeon, or marketer, or software engineer, someone can always replace you. It’s just too easy these days for people to move around and get new jobs.
* Employers can find better talent quicker than ever; customers are constantly trying new ideas and canceling on businesses. Your one thing is always under attack—and so is your livelihood.
* Multiplying is when you find the patterns that link different projects and then leverage those connections so each venture makes way more than it could have on its own.
* Multiplying is the epitome of working smarter, not harder.
* You pigeonhole yourself into one thing, you’ll lose the chance to recognize patterns and capitalize on them to multiply your income streams.
* You won’t have time to work on three huge, time-consuming projects at once. So focus 80 percent of your time on one project—the one that brings in the most money or that has the potential to be your biggest earner. Split the other 20 percent of your time between the two remaining ventures.

#### RULE 2: COPY YOUR COMPETITORS

* You’re wasting your time reading this book if you don’t embrace this one idea: You have to copy your competitors. Do it now. Do it aggressively. Do it quickly. And do it by spending the least amount of money you possibly can.
* Every successful entrepreneur has copied, even if they won’t admit it. You usually just don’t notice it because they’ve taken someone else’s idea and tweaked it for an entirely different industry.

#### RULE 3: QUIT SETTING GOALS - THEY'RE KEEPING YOU BROKE

* They (most people) prefer the short-term win. They need the instant gratification.
* They can’t give up rewards over the next week even if it means getting a better return as soon as the week after.
* Build systems around the things that take up most of your time. Sadly, most people don’t even know what those things are. How many of us are constantly busy but can’t look back on our day and say what we did? It’s all a blur. If that’s you (and even if it’s not), spend a week documenting what you’re doing. This kind of awareness forces you to be reflective and intentional, not reactive to whatever thing is in front of you.
* New Rich Systems are made up of the following elements:
  * **Inputs:** What do you have to feed the system to make it work? Your golden goose needs water and food every day to survive—among many other things.
  * **Outputs:** What does your system produce for you once it’s set up? Keep your golden goose alive, keep getting golden eggs.
  * **Feedback loops:** Can an output of your system get you better, cheaper, or faster inputs to create a snowball effect?
  * **Stocks:** Stocks are whatever assets pile up inside the system that then get used to generate an output.
* So the iterations of your system over time would look something like this:
  * Stage 1: Input = You + Fiverr freelancer
  * Stage 2: Input = You + Fiverr freelancer + Automation software
  * Stage 3: Input = Two Fiverr freelancers + Automation software (Your time is now free, so you use it to start building another system.)
  * Stage 4: Your system is creating cash flow as an output, which lets you go invest in new systems or invest in making your inputs and current systems more efficient.
* **Software:** If you spend a lot on software, point out that you have choices for whom to buy that software from and ask for a lower rate from your current vendors.
* Make sure the systems you’re spending most of your time and money on scaling have a direct correlation to additional cash flow, whether that’s downloads that translate to sponsor dollars, website impressions that convert to an increase in your average cart checkout size, if you’re an e-commerce brand, or a system for marketing the newspaper that drives more people to your brick-and-mortar location.
* People often get stuck working on systems that suck up their time but don’t bring in cash. It’s so tempting to lie to yourself because a system feels good when it isn’t actually accomplishing anything. So be hyperintentional about where you’re spending your time and ruthlessly kill any systems that don’t have a direct correlation to growing your bank account.

#### THE NEW RICH ARSENAL

* My advice in this book boils down to helping you do one core thing: set yourself up to have an unfair advantage against others.
* By “unfair” I don’t mean dishonest. You’ll just have such a major lead on your peers and competitors that they won’t possibly be able to catch up with you. It will be like they’re trying to wrestle someone two weight classes above them. They’ll have no chance at a win.
* It starts with masterful persuasion. Most people use their persuasion skills, or muscle, in the wrong ways every day. They try to persuade people to do stupid stuff, like getting their boss to give them a better office or their Facebook friends to like a post.
* The trick is to use your persuasion muscle for things that directly correlate to freeing up your time. Think about it: freedom is what most of us want. We want control over our own lives. The quickest and easiest way to get that freedom is by persuading others to do things that free up your time.
* Once you hit the sweet spot of having others doing the time-consuming stuff, you can focus on generating more cash flow for yourself. There you’ll need the art of negotiation
* Then things really get fun and lucrative. Calendar free, big wins negotiated, you’ll start valuing your time more because it’s all yours. That’s when productivity kicks in.
* I do this because our emotions drive most of our purchases, and fear is the strongest among them.
* When we fear something, we’ll do anything to fix the worry. The most profitable salespeople know this and they feed off our fear by selling the fix.
* People today are less rational and more emotional than ever, but it’s your decision whether to use that opportunity for good or for bad. Sell a great product and you can profit off fear without the moral dilemma.
* I’ve found seven fear principles that are most directly tied to driving sales and cash flow.
* When thinking about how your business ties into these, it’s not so much about how you can blatantly use one of these fears to sell your product. Rather, if you understand which fear you’re catering to, you can make sure your messaging reflects that. So if you were selling into Fear of the Unknown, you’d use words and phrases like “hidden,” “clever,” “never before seen” versus selling into Fear of Missing Out with words like “too late,” “few left,” “regret it later,” etc.
* Fear of Missing Out:
* When I’m recruiting someone to join my team I’m subtly using fear-based persuasion—in this case the fear of missing out—to persuade them to work with me.
* Fear of the Unknown:
* We spend tons of money triggered by what-if thinking. And companies love to heighten those what-if scenarios, those fears.
* The best advertisers are masters at planting “what if” questions in our heads that we never would have thought of. Once we hear their message, it feels urgent.
* A Tylenol ad might say, “Heading out on that beach vacation? Don’t forget Tylenol in your pocket to make sure headaches don’t ruin your trip.”
* Fear for Your Life:
* Think every life insurance policy ever sold. Every lawyer offering services around writing wills. Companies today are getting more creative about tapping into this fear, too.
* Fear for Your Health:
* Fear of Losing Freedom:
* The entire market of productivity tools feeds off this fear. Best-selling books like Tim Ferriss’s 4-Hour Workweek and David Allen’s Getting Things Done also tap into it. We’re afraid of somebody else controlling us—controlling our time, making us work eighty-hour weeks, putting a cap on our earning potential. We want our time back, and we want our freedom back. That’s why you’re reading this book.
* Fear of Loneliness:
* This is why social networks have taken off. They prey on your fear of being lonely by arbitrarily making you feel important with those little red notifications.
* They make you feel other humans are thinking about you, and it’s been widely argued that those little dopamine hits are not helpful at all.
* Fear of Failure
* If you’re launching a business you might spend thousands to alleviate your fear of failure: coaching services, online courses on how to pitch investors, top lawyers.
* Your odds of success spike if whatever you’re selling taps into multiple fears: People will pay for gym memberships out of fear for their health, fear of failure, and fear of loneliness if they worry they’ll never meet someone unless they get into shape.
* Fear is a powerful, powerful persuader. It’s obviously not the only persuasion tool out there, but it’s the most powerful motivator you can use to drive cash flow, even over the rosey-dosey “make the world a better place” sales points.
* Speaking of fear, one of the reasons you lose negotiations is when you fear you’re going to lose the negotiation. That’s why it’s best to start negotiations when that fear doesn’t exist. In other words, negotiate when you don’t have to.
* Let’s say you’ve got enough money in the bank to cover two or three months’ rent. You’re not feeling financial pressure, but you’d still prefer to pay less than the full amount. That creates leverage for you. And the best time to use leverage is when you don’t have to use it. So if you’re reading this right now, I want you to negotiate when you don’t have to.
* Negotiating when you don’t have to also gives you options.
* When someone asks me today what I do, I say, “I can’t really tell you.” That’s a good thing, because if they don’t know what I do, they can’t attack me. It’s the difference between being a round ball with no edges versus a square.
* When someone asks me today what I do, I say, “I can’t really tell you.” That’s a good thing, because if they don’t know what I do, they can’t attack me. It’s the difference between being a round ball with no edges versus a square.
* Remember, your best position in a negotiation is when you don’t need it to work out.
* To-do lists ruin us. We try and fail to cross things off them, then we think: If we can’t get through one day’s worth of tasks, how can we get that giant life-changing thing done in just a few months? It’s because we overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate what we can do in a year.
* Your brain short-circuits in the face of a huge project if you don’t organize your thinking. You have to sort your ideas and group them into yearlong terms. Then execute them weekly and make sure you live in the day so you don’t miss out on life. So you’re going to:
* Dream in Decades → Think in Years → Work in Weeks → Live in Days
* **Dream in Decades:** This is where you let your mind wander. Find a quiet space and let ideas build up as you dream about all the golden geese—and their golden eggs—that you want in your life. Think long, and think concretely: picture where you want to be in ten years, what your business, life, and home will look like.
* **Think in Years:** Remember when I told you in chapter 3 to take your big, audacious goals and break them down into systems? That’s thinking in years.
* **Work in Weeks:** This is where the huge dreams mesh with reality. You know what you want to do in a decade, and in a year. You know the systems you need to set in motion to make it happen.
* **Live in Days:** This is where the work thrives or dies because of our dysfunctional to-do lists. Most things on our list never get done. We add to them and let tasks roll over to the next day, and the cycle never ends.
* The big reason this happens is because we don’t set up a mental framework for removing to-do items from our list. I’m not talking about crossing off a task when it’s done—I mean killing the items that sit on our list day after day, week after week.
* I now evaluate my to-do list the same way I do my closet: the thirty-day rule. If I haven’t worn it in the last thirty days, and I don’t plan to wear it in the next thirty, it’s out.
* So here’s the secret to recognizing what you’ve accomplished over the past year without having to measure everything. You just need to measure one thing: money in the bank. If that number has gone up in a year, then double-check that you’re living the life you want by asking yourself: Do I feel good?

* THE NEW RICH TOOLBOX
  * Sell Off of Fear
  * Negotiate When You Don’t Have To
  * Ditch To-Do Lists and Build Out Your Systems
  * Batch Your Time

## MONEY: GET IT, KEEP IT, GROW IT

* “Financial peace isn’t the acquisition of stuff. It’s learning to live on less than you make, so you can give money back and have money to invest. You can’t win until you do this.” —Dave Ramsey
* The best way to start a new business—or any endeavor—is to keep your expenses really low.

#### LIVE LIKE A KING WITHOUT OWNING ANYTHING

* “Men acquire a particular quality by constantly acting a certain way.” —Aristotle
* I want you to jump-start your New Rich lifestyle before you can afford it, for two reasons. First—well, because you can, even if you think you can’t. But the more important reason is that once you give off the perception of being successful, more success will find you. It’s just how the universe works.
* The best real estate deals are found by door knocking and it’s the number one way I suggest you look for your first properties.

## HOW THE NEW RICH BUILD BUSINESSES

* The smarter thing to do, and what I do when I’m interested in making a larger investment in a company, is ask to see their numbers. I need them to show me at least a three- or four-year financial history before I consider investing. Anything less is too risky. And if they don’t have a structure for reporting that lets me look at their historical financials and see growth, I’m out. I also need to have confidence that once I put money in, I’ll get updated financial reports every month. If that doesn’t exist I stay away from the investment.
* Step 1. Find a hot industry: Use crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter to see what is getting the most funding and sites like Siftery.com to figure out which businesses are adding the most customers the fastest.
* Step 2. Figure out why leaders are leading: Use Ahrefs, SimilarWeb, and other tools to see how competitors get traffic.
* Step 3. Build your own version: Use Toptal or Upwork to build your own version of your competitor’s product. Start by copying what works, then read their support forums to add quick improvements.
* Step 4. Attack their distribution channels: Reach out to bloggers, influencers who previously shared your competitors. Use my script to persuade them to promote you.

#### MULTIPLY YOUR BUSINESS

* People often think the only way to grow a business is by expanding their customer base. Not true at all. Bringing in more customers is actually the last thing I try to do when strategizing revenue growth. It’s much more effective to think about how you can drive new income from people who are already paying or following you.
* One way to do this is by launching a new product that your customers say they also buy.
* Even if they already have that thing and don’t buy it again, new customers are likely to buy more from you because all your products appeal to them.
* The old saying “You have to be bought, not sold” is just that—old. Forget the tired thinking that you can only get a great offer for your business if buyers woo you into selling. You need to make it known that you want to sell—with a reason people will believe—to get conversations going.
* If selling will get money in your pocket now that would otherwise take you three years or more to earn by working in the company, take the deal. Then use the cash to start something new.
* The top 1 percent are smart. When they climb the ladder of success, they want to hoard, which means they must destroy the ladder so others can’t climb. They invent “rules” and work very hard to sell these rules to you so that you get stuck working for them. Focus on one thing! Copying is bad! Make sure you set goals! Ask customers what they want and give it to them!
