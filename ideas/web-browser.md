# Web Browser

I've been contemplating (and had a few attempts to build) a new web browser with focus on:

* **Privacy:** There is opportunities to make web browsers support privacy by default.
* **Security:** Web browsers identified platform problems causing security flaws - however, the product problems are not solved yet. e.g phishing scams with google ads set for bank website names
* **Productivity:** Today's web browsers are still based on ancient design decisions made for the internet 30 years ago. They fail to provide clarity and context of what user is interested at that moment, and require manual management of every single open tab.

## No Tabbing Bar ðŸ¤¯

Open as many tabs you'd like. Tabbing bar is removed to promote clarity and focus. See the next screenshots for the replacement.

## Private and 90s Modes ðŸ’¾

It allows you apply some important preferences on any websites. These preferences are:

* **Private Mode:** Keeps the site data (cookies etc) in a private partition, so the site can't profile you.
* **90s Mode:** Turns off some milennium technology we can live without (e.g JavaScript) so you get true 90s experience on the selected website. Works really nice.

Check it out in the gifcast below:

# See it in action

I recorded this gifcast tonight. It's not exactly how Fat Home Cat look like at the end, but you get the idea.

# Development Status

An early proof of concept of this browser [is available in Github](https://github.com/kaktus/kaktus).
