## Solving the distribution problem of farming

Farming has a distribution challenge in developing world;

* Traditional farming is not efficent
* Distributors (mostly local gangs) sets the market price for their own profit unethically
* Individual farmers can't get paid well

And an online platform that I'll explain below could solve this problem:

1) Let people purchase better quality, organic food directly from farmer. If you are a farmer, you can sign up to this system, upload photos of your products and let the world know about what you grow.

2) Make a better option for people who want to eat healthy and affordable food. As a customer, you can purchase vegetables, fruits or bakeries directly from a farmer, using your mobile phone and a bank card.

3) Create jobs for ordinary people who need extra income. The way we provide connection between farmer and customer is simply creating independent contractor jobs for anyone who can deliver food from farmer to customer in given time. If you’re someone who needs some extra income, you can simply go to my platform and pick a delivery job in your area.

In other words, I want to build an independent, fair-trade farming platform that revolutionize the way we trade food. Farmers will make more money, customers will buy organic and healthy food for cheaper, and the way we tackle the delivery problem will let ordinary people make extra income.

## Thinking process

Philosophers until now have only interpreted the world in various ways.

The point, however, is to change it.

Karl Marx said this 200 years ago when internet didn’t exist yet. 

He also wanted to change farming because he knew that if we change farming, we change the whole world. The way we get the food from earth, and the way we exchange it significantly impacts our mindsets, our personalities, our culture, and our planet.

We need to re-think farming, because it has been exercised based on the ideas with serious flaws, it doesn’t scale, and it’s not beneficial for anyone anymore.

Problem 1) We are producing more than we need with wasteful practices, and our culture is shifting from reuse and thriftiness to consumerism. Everything we don’t eat becomes thrash and valueless. And the system treats humans as consumers, the kings of the society. We don’t let those birds have their dirty little bites in your apples anymore because the apple you eat must shine like diamond, just like in the Hollywood movies. You, “the consumer” is the king. You deserve the best. You bought two bags of those apples and never had time to eat them because you’ve been working all the time? Throw them away, buy again! You feel guilty? You feel like a bad king? Donate some money to charity, and become a good king!

We need to change this mindset. The future should not, and according to science, can not be consumerism. You got some milk expired in your home ? The first idea that comes to your mind should be giving or selling it to someone who wants to make cheese with it. 

Problem 2) Farmers are not recognized. In the current economy we got, distribution networks dictate prices and remove the identity of the farmers from the market. Farmer’s can’t get paid well, and they get no credit for their hard work. The most significant and effective motivation behind why work is the feeling of making other people’s lives better. That feeling can make work more enjoyable than even taking a vacation.

Problem 3) The modern marketplaces are centralizing the economy, replacing the independent players with people who work for them. However we could empower all players, create a lot of jobs by letting by just letting the platform be independent and decentralized. We need to prioritize changing the world rather than profit, and I believe we can make this happen.

Solution:

The solution is to bring the technology together to connect and empower all players of the  farming. Workers, entrepreneurs, buyers, distributors, storage providers, cooperatives… Are you a farmer? Take photo of your product, put it on the platform and price it.  Are you a buyer looking for some fruits? Search products available around you and buy it by seeing their photos and reviews. Are you someone just looking for a job? Open up your phone and get a delivery done, make money by being your own boss. Isn’t this an achievable step for farming? 

And here is my plan; build a free, decentralized marketplace that can scale chaos for people who like to sell and buy not fresh food. This will be my priority rather than fresh food because I want to target people’s mindset directly and briefly. Once I make unfresh food mainstream, the rest of the market will already be there.
