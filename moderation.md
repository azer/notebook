### Running a Q&A

Notes from [James Damore at Portland State](https://youtu.be/VCrQ3EU8_PM?t=3209).

* We'd appreciate the people who disagree with what we've had to say if they come up first
* If you're agreeing and you want to support us that's great but if you wouldn't mind waiting until everybody who disagrees going
* We're looking for tough questions and we're looking for sincere & honest conversations
* One more thing if you could state your question we'd like to do as many questions as we possibly could
* So, don't pontificate, no stories, no proselytization; just what's your question and we'll feel those.
* Disagreements first!
