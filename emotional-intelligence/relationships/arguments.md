# Arguments

* An average couple will have between thirty and fifty significant arguments a year, “significant” meaning an encounter that departs sharply from civilized norms of dialog, would be uncomfortable to film and show friends, and might involve screaming, rolled eyes, histrionic accusations, slammed doors, and liberal uses of terms like “asshole” and “dickhead.”
* The first is that our Romantic culture sentimentally implies that there might be a necessary connection between true passion and a fiery temper. It can seem as if fighting and hurling insults might be signs, not of immaturity and a woeful incapacity for self-control, but of an admirable intensity of desire and strength of commitment.
* We argue badly and regularly principally because we lack an education in how to teach others who we are.
* A bad argument is a failed endeavor to communicate, which perversely renders the underlying message we seek to convey ever less visible.

## The Interminable Argument

* We keep arguing because we never manage to identify and address the key issue we’re actually cross about. Irritability is anger that lacks self-knowledge.

## The Defensive Argument

* When we’re on the receiving end of a difficult insight into our failings, what makes us bristle and deny everything isn’t generally the accusation itself (we know our flaws all too well**; it’s the surrounding atmosphere.
* We know the other is right, we just can’t bear to take their criticism on board, given how severely it has been delivered.
* We start to deny everything because we are terrified: the light of truth is shining too brightly. The fear is that if we admit our failings, we will be crushed, shown up as worthless, required to attempt an arduous, miserable process of change without sympathy or claim on the affections of the other.
* People don’t change when they are gruffly told what’s wrong with them; they change when they feel sufficiently supported to undertake the change they—almost always—already know is due.

## The Spoiling Argument

* There is a kind of argument that begins when one partner deliberately, and for no immediately obvious reason, attempts to spoil the good mood and high spirits of the other.

## The Pathologizing Argument

* There are arguments in which one person gets so upset that they start to behave in ways that range far beyond the imagined norms of civilized conduct: They speak in a high-pitched voice, they exaggerate, they weep, they beg, their words become almost incoherent, they pull their own hair, they bite their own hand, they roll on the floor.
* There’s a moment when the calm one may turn and say, “Since you are mad, there’s no point in talking to you.” The awareness—in the raging lover’s mind—that, as they rant and flail, they are ineluctably throwing away all possibility of being properly attended to or understood feeds their ever-mounting sense of panic: They become yet more demented and exaggerated, further undermining their credibility in the discussion.
* Hearing their condition diagnosed as insane by the calm one serves to reinforce a suspicion that perhaps they really are mad, which in turn weakens their capacity not to be so. They lose confidence that there might be any reasonable aspect to their distress that could, theoretically, be explained in a clear way if only they could stop crying.
* On the other side of the equation, the person who remains calm is automatically cast, by their own imperturbable nature and subtle skills at public relations, as decent and reasonable.
* But we should bear in mind that it is at least in theory entirely possible to be cruel, dismissive, stubborn, harsh, and wrong, and keep one’s voice utterly steady. Just as one can, equally well, be red-nosed, whimpering, and incoherent, and have a point.
* Rage and histrionics can be the symptoms of a desperation that sets in when a hugely important intimate truth is being blatantly ignored or denied, with the uncontrolled person being neither evil nor monstrous.
* If we lose our temper with our partners, it is likely because we are so invested in them and our joint futures.

## The Absentee Argument

* There are so many ways in which the world wounds us. At work, our manager repeatedly humiliates and belittles us. We hear of a party to which we were not invited. A better-looking, wealthier person snubs us at a conference. We develop a skill that turns out not to be much in demand in the world; some people were with at college setup a hugely successful business.
* Our hurt, humiliation, and disappointments accumulate—but almost always, we cannot possibly complain about them to anyone. Our managers would sack us if we told them how we felt. Our acquaintances would be horrified by the depth of our insecurities.
* We cannot rave at the cosmos or at the accidents of political power. We need, most of the time, simply to politely swallow our hurt and move on.
* But there is one exception to this rule: We can rant and moan at a person who is more reliably kind to us than anyone else, a person whom we love more than any other, a blessed being who is waiting for us at home at the end of every new grueling day...
* The fact that we are blaming our partner in ridiculous ways is a heavily disguised but authentic mark of the trust we have in them.
* We must be civilized and grown up with everyone else, but with one person on the planet, we can at points be maddeningly irrational, utterly demanding, and horribly cross, not because they deserve it, but because so much has gone wrong, we are so tired, and they are the one person who promises to understand and forgive us. No wonder we love them.

## The Argument of Normality

* Being in a relationship, even a very good one, requires us constantly to defend our preferences and points of view against the possibility of a partner's objections.
* In a pure sense, what is “normal” shouldn’t matter very much at all. What is widespread in our community is often wrong and what is currently considered odd might actually be quite wise.
* When it comes to personal life, we have no sound idea of what is normal, because we have no easy access to the intimate truths of others. We don’t know what a normal amount of sex really is, or how normal it is to cry, sleep in a different bed, or dislike a partner’s best friend. There are no reliable polls or witnesses.

## The Parental-Resemblance Argument

* In one side of our brains, we are aware of a range of negative qualities we observed in our parents that we sense are intermittently hinted at in our own personalities. And we are terrified.

## The Argument from Excessive Logic

* It seems odd at first to imagine that we might get angry, even maddened, by a partner because they are, in the course of a discussion, proving to be too reasonable and too logical.
* An excessively logical approach to fears discounts their origins and concentrates instead on why we shouldn’t have them, which is maddening when we are in pain. It’s not that we actually want our partner to stop being reasonable; we want them to apply their intelligence to the task of sensitive reassurance. We want them to enter into the weirder bits of our own experience by remembering their own.

## The No-Sex Argument

* The absence of sex matters so much because sex itself is the supreme conciliator and salve of all conflict, ill feeling, loneliness, and lack of interest. It is almost impossible to make love and be sad, indifferent, or bitter.
