# Relationships

From [Arguments](./arguments.md)

* We argue badly and regularly principally because we lack an education in how to teach others who we are.
* Irritability is anger that lacks self-knowledge.
* When it comes to personal life, we have no sound idea of what is normal, because we have no easy access to the intimate truths of others.

From [Pessimism](./pessimism.md)

* We are a lot calmer around prestigious problems.
* Domestic preoccupation isn’t really a sign of the death of love. It’s what awaits us when love has succeeded.

From [Marriage](./marriage.md)

* The point of marriage is to be usefully unpleasant—at least at crucial times.
