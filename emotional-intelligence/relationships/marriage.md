## A Modest Argument for Marriage

* The essence of marriage is to tie our hands, to frustrate our wills, to put high and costly obstacles in the way of splitting up, and sometimes to force two unhappy people to stay in each other’s company for longer than either of them would wish. Why do we do this?

#### 1. Impulse is Dangerous

* It is a very unusual marriage in which the couple don’t spend a notable amount of time fantasizing that they aren’t in fact married.

#### 2. We Grow and Develop Gradually

* At their best, relationships involve us in attempts to develop, mature, and become “whole.” We often get drawn to people precisely because they promise to edge us in the right direction.

#### 3. Investment Requires Security

* Marriage sets up the conditions in which we can take valuable decisions about what to do with our lives that would be too risky outside its guarantees.
* The point of marriage is to be usefully unpleasant—at least at crucial times.
