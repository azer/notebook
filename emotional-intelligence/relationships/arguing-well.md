# Arguing well

* A number of qualities are required to ensure that a couple know how to argue well.
* First and foremost, the need for each party to be able to pinpoint sources of discomfort in themselves early and accurately: to know how to recognize what they are unhappy about and what they need in order to flourish in the couple.
* One might need to wait until some of the surface tension has dissipated; perhaps the next morning can do just as well. One needs a background confidence not to have to blurt out every objection in a panicked diatribe or shout a wounded feeling across the room when the other is themselves too upset to hear it. One needs to know how to formulate oneâ€™s complaints into a convincing, perhaps even humorously framed point that has a chance of winning over its target.
