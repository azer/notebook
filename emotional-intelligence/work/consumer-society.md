# Consumer Society

* The one way to generate wealth, argued Mandeville, was to ensure high demand for absurd and unnecessary things.
* Mandeville shocked his audience with the starkness of the choice he placed before them. A nation could either be very high-minded, spiritually elevated, intellectually refined, and dirt poor, or a slave to luxury and idle consumption, and very rich.
* We simply accept that we will live in consumer economies with some very unfortunate side effects to them (crass advertising, unhealthy foodstuffs, products that are disconnected from any reasonable assessment of our needs, excessive waste … ) in exchange for economic growth and high employment. We have chosen wealth over virtue.
* The ultimate goal of capitalism was to tackle “happiness” in all its complexities, psychological as opposed to merely material.
* The reform of capitalism hinges on an odd-sounding but critical task: the conception of an economy focused around higher needs.

## Higher Needs, A Pyramid, And Capitalism

* The idea that capitalism can give us what we need has always been central to its defense.
* More efficiently than any other system, capitalism has, in theory, been able to identify what we’re lacking and deliver it to us with unparalleled efficiency. Capitalism is the most skilled machine we have ever yet constructed for satisfying human needs.
* The true destiny of and millennial opportunity for consumer capitalism is to travel up the pyramid, to generate ever more of its profits from the satisfaction of the full range of “higher needs” that currently lie outside the realm of industrialization and commodification.

## The Promises of Advertising

* We are often brought to tears not so much by what is horrible as by what is beautiful but out of reach.
* The real crisis of capitalism is that product development lags so far behind the best insights of advertising.
* Since the 1960s, advertising has worked out just how much we need help with the true challenges of life. It has fathomed how deeply we want to have better careers, stronger relationships, greater confidence. In most adverts, the pain and the hope of our lives have been superbly identified, but the products are almost comically at odds with the problems at hand.

## Artistic Sympathy

* Poverty not only induces financial harm but damages mental health as well.
