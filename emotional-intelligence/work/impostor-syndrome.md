# Impostor Syndrome

* Faced with hurdles, we often leave the possibility of success to others, because we don’t seem to ourselves to be anything like the sorts of people who win.
* The root cause of impostor syndrome is an unhelpful picture of what people at the top of society are really like.
* We feel like impostors not because we are uniquely flawed, but because we can’t imagine how equally flawed the elite must necessarily also be underneath their polished surfaces.
* Impostor syndrome has its roots far back in childhood—specifically in the powerful sense children have that their parents are really very different from them.
