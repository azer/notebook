# Specialization

* The big economic reason why we can’t explore our potential as we might is that it is hugely more productive for us not to do so.
* Adam Smith was astonishingly prescient. Doing one job, preferably for most of one’s life, makes perfect economic sense.
* Every occupation weakens or reinforces aspects of our nature.
* By giving a large part of one’s life over to a specific occupation, one necessarily has to perform an injustice to other areas of latent potential.
* Compared to the play of childhood, we’re all leading fatally restricted lives. There is no easy cure. As Adam Smith argued, the causes don’t lie in some personal error we’re making. It’s a limitation forced upon us by the **greater logic of a competitive market economy**.
* But we can allow ourselves to mourn that there will always be large aspects of our character that won’t be satisfied. We’re not being silly or ungrateful. We’re simply registering the clash between the demands of the employment market and the free, wide-ranging potential of every human life.
* Specialization brings advantages: It means we can focus, bring up children in stable environments, and learn the **disciplines of compromise**. In love and work, life requires us to be specialists even though we are by nature equally suited for wide-ranging exploration.
* Whatever we do, parts of our potential will have to go undeveloped and have to die without ever having had the chance to come to full maturity—for the sake of the benefits of focus and specialization.
