# Work

From [Good Child](./good-child.md)

* Almost everything interesting, worth doing or important will meet with a degree of opposition.
* Every noble ambition has to skirt disaster and ignominy.
* Being properly mature involves a frank, unfrightened relationship with one’s own darkness, complexity, and ambition. It involves accepting that not everything that makes us happy will please others or be honored as especially “nice,” but it can be important to explore and hold on to it nevertheless.

From [Impostor Syndrome](./impostor-syndrome.md)

* The root cause of impostor syndrome is an unhelpful picture of what people at the top of society are really like.
* The solution to the impostor syndrome lies in making a leap of faith and trusting that others’ minds work basically in much the same way as our own. Everyone is probably as anxious, uncertain, and wayward as we are.

From [Specialization](./specialization.md)

* Every occupation weakens or reinforces aspects of our nature.
