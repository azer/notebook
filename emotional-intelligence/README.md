# Emotional Intelligence

> Know yourself.
―  Socrates

* Intelligence is a catch-all word for what is in fact a range of skills directed at a number of different challenges.
* Emotionally intelligent person searches accommodation between their inner priorities and the demands of the world.

From [Inner Voice](./inner-voice.md);

*  We know how to treat our own friends with a sympathy and imagination that we don’t apply to ourselves. We need to become better friends to ourselves.
* The good friend is compassionate. When we fail, as we will, they are understanding and generous around our mishaps.

From [Therapy](./therapy.md)

* People will continue to misunderstand us
* We’ll meet with opposition
* There will be things it would be nice to have that will be out of reach
* Success will come to people who don’t appear to deserve it
* And much that’s good about us won’t be fully appreciated by others
* We’ll still have to compete and submit to the judgment of others
* We’ll still be lonely sometimes; and therapy won’t stop us having to watch the
* People we love will pass away
* We'll fall ill and eventually die ourselves.

From [Solace](./solace.md)

* It takes a great deal of bravery and skill to keep even a very ordinary life going.
