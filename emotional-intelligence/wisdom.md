# Wisdom

* Wisdom can be said to comprise twelve ingredients.

**1. Realism**

* The wise rarely expect anything to be wholly easy or to go entirely well.

**2. Appreciation**

* Properly aware that much can and will go wrong, the wise are unusually alive to moments of calm and beauty, even extremely modest ones, of the kind that those with grander plans rush past.

**3. Folly**

* The wise know that all human beings, themselves included, are never far from folly.
* The wise are unsurprised by the ongoing coexistence of deep immaturity and perversity alongside quite adult qualities like intelligence and morality.

**4. Humor**

* The wise take the business of laughing at themselves seriously. They hedge their pronouncements and are skeptical in their conclusions.

**5. Politeness**

* The wise are realistic about social relations, in particular about how difficult it is to change people’s minds and have an effect on their lives.
* They want, above all, things to be nice in social settings, even if this means they are not totally authentic.

**6. Self-Acceptance**

* The wise have made their peace with the yawning gap between how they would ideally want to be and what they are actually like.

**7. Forgiveness**

* The wise are comparably realistic about other people. They recognize the extraordinary pressure everyone is under to pursue their own ambitions, defend their own interests, and seek their own pleasures.
* The wise are therefore slow to anger and judge.

**8. Resilience**

* The wise have a solid sense of what they can survive. They know just how much can go wrong and things will still be—just about—liveable.

**9. Envy**

* The wise appreciate the role of luck and don’t curse themselves overly at those junctures where they have evidently not had as much of it as they would have liked.

**10. Success and Failure**

* The wise emerge as realistic about the consequences of winning and succeeding.
* They don’t exaggerate the transformations available to us. They know how much we remain tethered to some basic dynamics in our personalities, whatever job we have or material possession we acquire.

**11. Regrets**

* We will make some extremely large and utterly uncorrectable errors in a number of areas. Perfectionism is a wicked illusion. Regret is unavoidable.

**12. Calm**

* The wise know that turmoil is always around the corner, and they have come to fear and sense its approach. That’s why they nurture such a strong commitment to calm.
