# Classics vs. Romantics

* For a long time now, perhaps since around 1750, Romantic attitudes have been dominant in the Western imagination. The prevailing approach to children, relationships, politics, and culture has all been colored more by a romantic than by a cllassical spirit.
* Both Romantic and Classical orientations have important truths to impart. Neither is wholly right or wrong. They need to be balanced. And none of us are in any case ever simplu one or the other.
* But because a good life requires a judicious balance of both positions, at this point in history it might be the Classical attitude whose distinctive claims and wisdom we need to listen to most intently. It is a mode of approaching life that is ripe for rediscovery.

## Intuition vs. Analysis

* We should more often be guided by our instincts and the voice of nature within us.
* We need to fall silent—more frequently than we do—and simply listen.
* Reason is the sole tool we have available to defend ourselves against primeval chaos.

## Spontaneity vs. Education

* Romantics don’t like schools. The best kind of education comes from within. The most important capacities are in us from the start.
* Those of a Classical temperament don’t necessarily respect the education system as it stands—there is so much that could be improved—but the abstract idea of education seems essential and the bedrock of civilization.

## Honesty vs. Politeness

* There is too much hypocrisy already, say the Romantics. We are drowning in our lies and in our compromises. We must do everything to strip away the secrecy our society imposes on us. **Authenticity is the highest form of morality.** Politeness is a lid that we place upon our real selves to supress the truths that could free us.
* For the Classical person, politeness is the lid we generously place on our inner madness to stop hurting those we care for.
* Strategic inauthenticity is the mark of a kindly soul.

## Idealism vs. Realism

* The Romantic is excited by how things might ideally be and judges what currently exists in the world by the standard of a better imagined alternative.
* Most of the time, the current state of society arouses intense disappointment and anger as they consider the injustices, prevarications, compromises, and timidity all around.
* By contrast, the Classical person pays special attention to what can go wrong. They are very concerned to mitigate the downside. They are aware that most things could be a lot worse.

## Earnestness vs. Irony

* Romantics don’t believe in how things are. Their attention is fixed on how they should be. They therefore resist the deflationary call of ironic humor, which seems defeatist. They are earnest in their search for a better future.
* The Classical conviction is not that the world is a cheerful place, far from it; but rather that a cheerful mood is a good starting point for living in a radically imperfect and deeply unsatisfactory realm where the priority is to not give up, despair and kill oneself.

## The Rare vs. The Everyday

* The Romantic rebels against the ordinary. They are keen on the exotic and the rare. They like things that the mass of the population won't yet know about.
* They don’t much like routine, especially in domestic life, either. They are anxious about higher things being put under pressure to become “useful” or commercial. They want heroism, excitement and an end to boredom.
* **The Classical personality welcomes routine as a defense against chaos.** They would very much like good things to be popular. They don’t necessarily think that what is presently popular is good, but they see popularity as, in principle, a mark of virtue. They are familiar enough with extremes to welcome things that are a little boring. They can see the charm of doing the laundry.

## Purity vs. Ambivalence

* The Romantic is dismayed by compromise. They are drawn to either wholehearted endorsament or total rejection.
* The Classical person takes the view that very few things, and no people, are either wholly good or entirely bad. They assume that there is likely to be some worth in opposing ideas and something to be learned from both sides. It is Classical to think that a decent person might in many areas hold views you find deeply unpalatable.
