## 01: Context and Background

* We inhabit **time and space**. Our territories are spatio-temporal.
* What do you do when you don't know where you are? If you're a computer, you crash. If you're a human, you freeze, like a frozen rabbit when it thinks a fox is looking at it: **the prey response**.
* **A belief system** is a set of moral guidelines about how we should behave and perceive.
* We can't look at anything without a **hierarchy of value**. This hierarchy helps us decide what to look at.
* If everything is equally important or unimportant, it's **chaos**. A value system structures the way we perceive the world and also guide our actions as we act in accordance with our values.
* We have values that we may not know ourselves. We can tell that because sometimes we tell ourselves to study but we don't. We're not really in control of ourselves to any great degree.
* A productive society would match their belief systems and cooperate to get and give what they want to eachother. This would stop people from being anxious, make them happy and save them from **death anxiety**.
* If you think of territory as a domain where the fundamental presuppositions of each citizen are matched by the behavior of their co-citizens, people have reason to **defend** their territory.
* There might be more than one form of truth. **Pragmatic truth** is deeper than scientific truth.
* Pragmatic truth is the truths that enable you to act in a manner that best, improves the probability -rougly speaking- of your existence and your reproduction maximally.
* In most cultures, **music** plays a central role to **identity formation**. As we age, we'll find out that our favorite music that you listened to between the ages of 16 and 20. It defines a generation. Highly likely, in our tribal past, when you were inculcated into tribal culture, it was with dance, masks and music, all at same time. You were invited to take your place in the drama.
* Is the drama real? **Great dramas** are more than real. They are **hyperreal**; they provide guidelines about how to act. They're abstract, perhaps even generic; applicapable to broad range of situations.
* **Chaos** is the place you end up when what you're doing and the world stop matching.
* According to [Paglia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Paglia); **articulate knowledge** is embedded in inarticulate knowledge. **Inarticulate knowledge** is domain of art and literature.
* [Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung) believed that there was this domain we had mastered, and there was domain outside, which you can think of as **unexplored territory**. We try to figure out how to deal with the unexplored territory with our **creative imagination**. We're producing dramas that we could act out that would help us deal with what we still hadn't mastered.
* [Paglia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Paglia)'s idea was that without understanding that **surround**, we're too atomized. We're not part of our **historical tradition**, we haven't incorporated the **spirit of our ancestors** who built all this. We're just here now; we don't know how to maintain our culture and serve it.
* People ask what the **meaning of life** is. It seems to me that, meaning is proportionate to the **adoption of responsibility**.
* Noone argues with their **pain**. So we could say, the ultimate reality is pain.
* Real **self-consciousness** is the knowledge of our borders. Not only in space, but in the time.
* You inhabit a **story**: you're somewhere and you're going somewhere. There is a gradient between where you are and where you're aiming at. Hypotetically, you're aiming something better, so; you're in a **state of insufficiency**, the insufficiencies change, and you're trying to rectify the insufficiency, you presume that your current state is less preferable to the state you're aiming at. You bring those two together through  **actions** in the world.
* This is an answer to the **mind body problem**; you have a conceptual structure, but when you implement it, you're implementing it through action; not abstractly. It's the framework through which you view the world, so it's a **value laden framework**.
* **Chaos** is what you experience when your story falls apart; that's a descent to the underworld. We live in order and chaos. **Order** is where when you do what you think you should do, what you want to have have happen, happens; that's order, explored territory. Chaos is when you do what you're supposed to do to get what you want and it doesn't happen.
* Next thing is straightforward; **individual** exists in **culture** and culture is embedded in **nature**.
* **Culture** is **tyrannical** because we have to shape yourself, involuntarily even to get along with other people. We sacrifice a lot of ourselves in that endeavor. We have to average ourselves out in order to live together. Some societies are more tyrannical than others, but there is always a tyrannical element.
* **Unexplored territory** is a conceptual territory, wherever you are when things aren't working for you the way they're supposed to be.
* Human response to unexplored territory is **generalized stress response**; we freeze, produce a lot of cortisol and adrenaline and pay more attention. The problem is, one can stay in this state forever, and this is kind of **PTSD**. This will lead to anxiety disorder, getting older, burning up resources like mad as the system is shunting everything to maintain the state of **emergency preparation**. This is why people are so prone to defend their familiar territories; if their familiar territory is invaded or disrupted, they default back to this state of emergency preparation, which can unglue them.
* The idea of human beings travel to the underworld and come back is a really useful thing to understand; whenever we fail, whoop, down into the underworld for a while, where everything is in chaos, we sort ourselves out, bang, we're back up!
* One way of conceptualizing yourself is not as order, and not as chaos; but as the thing that traverses between the two domains; and that is the mythological hero.
* Your cognition has multiple layers, you understand things, that you don't know you understand, in ways that you don't understand.
* (In movies) Music provides emotional background, the complex context, it's like a substitute for the context, guides you. We're willing to accept the amplification of the reality, that constitutes a movie.
* There are people you admire, and there are you don't admire. That's a clue about your value system. It's as if something inside you looking for something admirable. The person you admire has a faculty that you'd like to have for yourself; they're model for emulation. The fact that you find something admirable is a hint as to the structure of your unconscious value system.
* There is a difference between asking yourself a question and thinking about it.
* You need to write about the future, because, you aren't going to hit something unless you aim at it. Lots of times people won't aim at what they want because they're afraid. The reason they're afraid is because if you specify what you want you have specified your conditions of failure; it's better to just keep foggy; it's like, well, I don't know if I'm succeeding or failing.
* If you have a memory that's more than 18 months old, when you bring it to mind and it has a -especially negative- emotional impact; it's like part of your soul is stuck back there. You have not solved the problem that situation faced you with. Your braing is still tagging it as a threat and it's a part of the territory you did not master. Articulation, writing really helps that. 2:19
