# Dialectical Behaviour Therapy

### Skills

There are four sets of skills taught in DBT: 

 * **Core mindfulness skills:** help people to live more in the present moment and bring an accepting, open attitude to their experience; 
 * **Distress tolerance skills:** help people to get through crisis situations without making things worse; 
 * **Emotion regulation skills:** help people learn more about emotions and healthier ways of managing them; 
 * **Interpersonal effectiveness skills:** help people to be more effective in their relationships, through such things as assertive communication. 

### Re-regulation of emotions

#### Do a forward bend

Bend over as though you’re trying to touch your toes (it doesn’t matter if you can actually touch your toes; you can also do this sitting down if you need to, by sticking your head between your knees). Take some slow, deep breaths, and hang out there for a little while (30 to 60 seconds if you can). Doing a forward bend actually activates our parasympathetic nervous system – our ‘rest and digest’ system – which helps us slow down and feel a little calmer. When you’re ready to stand up again, just don’t do it too quickly – you don’t want to fall over.

#### Focus on your exhale with ‘paced breathing’

focus on making your exhale longer than your inhale – this also activates our parasympathetic nervous system, again helping us feel a little calmer and getting those emotions back to a more manageable level. When you inhale, count in your head to see how long your inhale is; as you exhale, count at the same pace, ensuring your exhale is at least a little bit longer than your inhale. For example, if you get to 4 when you inhale, make sure you exhale to at least 5. For a double whammy, do this breathing while doing your forward bend.

#### Increase awareness of your emotions

In order to manage emotions more effectively in the long run, you need to be more aware of your emotions and of all their components; and you need to learn to name your emotions accurately.
