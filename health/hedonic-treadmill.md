# Hedonic Treadmill

Source: [psychology today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/hedonic-treadmill)

The hedonic treadmill is the idea that an individual's level of happiness, after rising or falling in response to positive or negative life events, ultimately tends to move back toward where it was prior to these experiences.

One's baseline level of well-being, or "set point," is not necessarily emotionally neutral—it is likely positive for most people—and it is not the same for everyone. A person may also have different baselines for different aspects of well-being (overall life satisfaction versus the amount of positive emotions experienced, for example).

The process by which positive or negative effects on happiness fade over time is called hedonic adaptation.
